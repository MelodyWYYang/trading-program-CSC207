# trading-program-CSC207
Trading program created during CSC207 course. Users must create an account first, and choose whether they are browsing-only or traders. User can add any item to their inventory, however it must be approved by the Admin before the item is available for trade and viewable by other users. Users set up a time and location to meetup/trade item(s), and report back as to whether the trade was completed or not. Items can also be given away (a "one-way" trade). Trades can be permanent or expire in one month. The program will remind and request confirmation of items having been traded back by the right date. Currently serves users within Toronto, Vancouver, or Montreal. Cross-province trading not possible.
